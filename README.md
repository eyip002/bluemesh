# BlueMesh (Flex 3)

BlueMesh is a relational editor. For a set of entities, relations can be made between them. BlueMesh displays entities as rectangular graphics and relationships as lines. Relationships are created between connection sites around each entity.

This is an early rewrite of BlueMesh in Flex 3.  BlueMesh is intended to be used within a web browser.

This project started as a final year project as part of the Computer Systems Engineering degree at The University of Auckland.
