#BlueMesh

BlueMesh is a relational editor. For a set of entities, relations can be made between them. BlueMesh displays entities as rectangular graphics and relationships as lines. Relationships are created between connection sites around each entity.

BlueMesh is written in ActionScript 2 (requires Adobe Flash Player version 6 or above).  BlueMesh is intended to be used within a web browser.  [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/) was used as the IDE.

This project started as a final year project as part of the Computer Systems Engineering degree at The University of Auckland.
